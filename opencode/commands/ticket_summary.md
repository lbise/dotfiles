I want to create a bullet list containing a summary of current redmine tickets

* Fetch all tickets for user 13lbise (id 272) with status either "In Progress" or "Resolved" (status ID 2 or 3)
* Create a single list containing both "In Progress" and "Resolved" tickets.
* For each ticket create a one line summary ending the line by the ticket number in () starting with a # and with a link to https://ch03rdteam.phonak.com/redmine/issues/<ticket>
* The bullet list should be formatted in html so it can be pasted in a confluence page without additional formatting
